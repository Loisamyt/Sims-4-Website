    <h1 align="center"> How to download Sims 4 cc </h1>
    <p align="center">Hi! this is a helpful guide on how to safely and quickly install CC to your Sims 4 game:)
      What is CC (custom content)?
      Many players of The Sims 4 choose to enhance their game with custom content. Created by fans, custom content, or CC as it's often known, is a free way to add new clothing, hairstyles, furniture, and more to your game.
      *note, you need to have The Sims 4 game downloaded already* </p>

      <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
  <li class="list-group-item">Visit <a href="https://www.thesimsresource.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> to find the perfect CC (custom content) for your game.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Press the download button and wait for the website to tell you that it has succesfully been downloaded.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Open your file explorer and go to your ‘downloads’ folder.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Select the CC that you recently downloaded and drag it into ‘This pc > documents > Electronic arts > The Sims 4 > Mods’.
  *note, if it is a zip/package file you need to ‘export here’*</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Open your Sims game, go to ‘Game Options’, then ‘Other’. From there, you can select ‘Enable custom content and mods’ , then press the ‘apply changes’ button.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Restart (exit/end game then go back in) your Sims game and the CC (custom content) should be in there.</li>
